<h2><b>How to use my Chuzzle Save Editor!</b></h2>

Note: Currently only works for Classic and Speed saves.
<br>To begin, click "File", then "Open".

<br>

<br>There are two directories you should check for your saves.
<br>

<br>1. C:\Users\USER\Documents\my games\Chuzzle\Profiles\ACCOUNT
<br>2. C:\ProgramData\PopCap Games\Chuzzle\Profiles\ACCOUNT

<br>

<br>Navigate to either directory listed above, and open one of the following:

<br>
<br>Classic:  SAVEGAME-CHUZZLEPUZZLE.DAT
<br>Speed:    SAVEGAME_SPEEDCHUZZLE.DAT


<br><h2><b>How To Use Buttons:</b></h2>

 - Click any of the buttons in the middle column to select how you wish to paint the board.
<br> - Clicking a chuzzle after clicking "Super" or "Lock" merely toggles that state for that chuzzle.
<br> - the button and textbox to the right of "Lock" will be for custom colors above rainbow, more on that later.
<br> - To save a new score, level, or scramble count, type said number into the box and then click "Set XXXXX". The label below this button is the boards current "XXXXX".


<br><h2><b>How To Save Your Board!</b></h2>

So essentially, in order to actually play the board you have made, in the chuzzles game itself, you cannot be in that gamemode at that time, for Chuzzles automatically saves the current board to the file when you exit it.
<br>

<br> - Exit to chuzzle Main Menu(In Game), then click "File"->"Save".
<br> - Open that gamemode in chuzzles to see your creation!

<br>Also Ctrl-S DOES NOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS. lol.</h2></b>
